# Layan theme for Zellij

*Simple Layan theme for Zellij*

## Install
To install you simply have to insert the code into the config file which can be found at `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`
If there is no file simply create the directory with `mkdir ~/.config/zellij` and run: `zellij setup --dump-config > ~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`

1. Find the example Dracula theme and underneath that section of code insert the layan.kdl code. Make sure it is not commented
2. Uncomment the *theme* line and replace "default" with "layan"
